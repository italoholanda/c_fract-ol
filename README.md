# FRACT'OL

## What is a fractal?
Fractals are geometric patterns that can be visible in whatever scale of a figure. Are like those graphics where you can zoom and observe the same image repeating infinitely in different proportions.

## About the project
It is a **42 Network** Computer Graphics project about algebraic fractals. Here, we will study the following implementations: Mandelbrot and Julia.
So, let's generate this using linear equations and recursion.

### Mandelbrot

The Mandelbrot is the fractal defined by a set of ```C``` points in a complex plane, which his sequence does not tend to infinity. We can express this like ```Z(n+1) = Z(n^2) + C```, such that ```Z(0) = 0```.

### Julia

The Julia set drift by dynamic polynomial study in complex planes. Are generated by the quadratic function ```fc(z) = zÂ² + c```.
